a)  See the LinearRecursion and MultipleRecursion classes for
    the implementations of the algorithms.

b)  The Linear Recursion Algorithm is of exponential space
    complexity as it is not using tail recursion. Therefore,
    every time the method calls itself (LinearRecursion : 58)
    it must wait for the next call to finish before it can finish
    (it follows a first-in-last-out order). As for the time
    complexity, the algorithm seems to follow a linear complexity
    (executed n-2 times every time, meaning it is O(n)).

c)  The Linear Recursion Algorithm does not currently implement
    tail recursion, as the recursive call is not the last
    instruction to be executed. It has been implemented that way
    because the only parameter given to the function is the number
    of elements we want to calculate.
